## Changing Pictures
You can update the images displayed in the carousel by modifying the `img` tags in the HTML file.

1. Locate the Images Section
   In the `index.html` file, locate the following code block under the `cards` div:
   ```html
   <label class="card" for="item-1" id="song-1">
       <img src="URL_OF_IMAGE_1" alt="song">
   </label>
   <label class="card" for="item-2" id="song-2">
       <img src="URL_OF_IMAGE_2" alt="song">
   </label>
   <label class="card" for="item-3" id="song-3">
       <img src="URL_OF_IMAGE_3" alt="song">
   </label>
   ```

2. Replace Image URLs
   Replace the `src` attribute of each `<img>` tag with the URL of the desired image. For example:
   ```html
   <img src="https://example.com/new-image.jpg" alt="New Song">
   ```

3. Save the changes and refresh the browser to see the new images.

##Changing Background Colors
The background color for each card is controlled by the CSS classes in the `styles.css` file.

1. Locate the Background Classes
   In `styles.css`, find the following classes:
   ```css
   body.bg-1 {
       background-color: #c394f8; /* Background for card 1 */
   }

   body.bg-2 {
       background-color: #172A3A; /* Background for card 2 */
   }

   body.bg-3 {
       background-color: #428aa6; /* Background for card 3 */
   }
   ```

2. Update Background Colors
   Replace the `background-color` property value with your desired color. For example:
   ```css
   body.bg-1 {
       background-color: #FF5733; /* New background color for card 1 */
   }
   ```

3. Save the changes and refresh the browser to see the updated background colors.
